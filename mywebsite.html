	Hello, my name is Will Weihnacht and this is my website. I'm a computer science student from San Francisco, CA currently in my third year at University of Maryland. I've been interested in computers since middle school when my friend's father introduced me to Basic. From then on my interest and ability have only increased. I have done projects in several different languages and on a variety of topics. I am currently looking for a internship or job offer in the DC metro area or San Francisco involiving software development. Please have a look around my site.
